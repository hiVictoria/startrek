 # Fun with functional programming and structs

 *A recap from the lecture slides:*
 
 **map()**
 ::
 Takes a value out of a container, applies a function to it, then puts the result of that function back into a new container that gets returned to you.
 
 **compactMap()**
 ::
 The compactMap() function is a variant of map() that removes nil objects and automatically unwraps optional values.
 
 **filter()**
 ::
 The filter() method loops over every item in a collection, and passes it into a function that you write. If your function returns true for that item it will be included in a new array, which is the return value for filter().
 
 **reduce()**
 ::
 The reduce() function condenses an array into a single value by applying a function to every item. Each time the function is called, you get passed the previous value from your function as well as the next item in your array.
 
 **sorted()**
 ::
 Can do basic sorts on arrays without even passing arguments to it, but can also pass in blocks that handle more complex sorting if using *by:* parameter.
